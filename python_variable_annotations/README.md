# Python 3 Variable Annotation Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing Python 3 variable annotations, a feature that allows for the explicit declaration of variable types, improving code readability and maintainability.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to explore and master the use of variable annotations in Python 3. Variable annotations help developers and collaborators understand the intended data types of variables, making the code more predictable and reducing the likelihood of errors.
